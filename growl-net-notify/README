This script is a Weechat-based script that makes use of Net::Growl for itâ€™s Growl notifications. At the time of writing this script, the only notification program for Growl (which we borrowed from), used Mac::Growl which required Weechat to be running on the same machine as Growl.

For more information on setting this script up over a reverse-proxy SSH session, or just opening the UDP port 9887 for Net::Growl, check out this blog post.

Commands are as follows:

/growl or /gl can be used to perform these commands:

/growl on: turn on growl notifications
/growl off: turn off growl notifications
/growl setup [host] [password] [port]: change the parameters for registration/notification with Growl
/growl inactive [time_in_seconds]: number of seconds of inactivity before we notify
/growl status: gives info on notification and inactivity settings
/growl test [message]: send a test message

UPDATE: Script now works with 0.2.7-dev as well as being backward compatible with 0.2.6. And no longer depends on Parse::IRC
